# Messenger Clone Application

Welcome to the Messenger Clone project! This project is a full stack chat application, developed as a clone of the popular Messenger app. It leverages modern technologies including Next.js 13, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MongoDB, NextAuth, and Pusher for real-time functionalities. The idea behind this project was to create an application that replicates the functionality and design of Messenger, providing real-time chatting capabilities, secure authentication, and a sleek, modern UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13:** A production-ready web framework for building React applications. Used for routing, server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Provides efficient, declarative, and flexible solutions to build interactive UIs.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Provides low-level utility classes that lets you build completely custom designs.
- **Prisma:** An open source next-generation ORM. It simplifies database workflows and makes developers more productive with its type-safe and auto-completion friendly API.
- **MongoDB:** A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Used to store our application data as documents in a binary representation.
- **NextAuth.js:** A complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It is designed from the ground up to support Next.js and Serverless.
- **Pusher:** A host of APIs designed to enable developers to build real-time functionality. Used in this project to implement real-time chat capabilities.
